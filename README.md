Stops obnoxious tab title toggling

Sites like Albion will toggle the SEO title of the page & a chat "message" to draw attention to the chatbot. Even when the chatbot is dismissed or deleted. 

Jan 2025 - Added anything by videowise. Tiktok carousels and popup videos aren't technically chat bubbles but they fill the same niche

Save as a snippet or copy and paste into the console to lock the title and delete annoying elements.

I've created a chrome extension that you can download and install from this google drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V8vG3uikFYTcrNp7WUGTbuE8ZNyHlNDw?usp=sharing

The extension is having issues blocking the tab title toggle for some chat apps. Lmk if you know any tricks there! The console command still works for 100% of title toggles I've encountered
